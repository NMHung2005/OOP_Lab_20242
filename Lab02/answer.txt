- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Ans: Yes, Java allows you to create multiple constructors in a class (constructor overloading), Java differentiates constructors based on their parameter

- Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
Ans: a Pass by value language

- After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
In Java, the parameter passed to a method is just a copy of the object reference, not the original reference itself.
When we assign o1 = o2, only the value of the reference variable within the swap method changes, but the original reference outside the method remains unaffected.

- After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
In changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), we call dvd.setTitle(Title). Because dvd reference to a object, this dvd.setTitle(Title) actually changes the data of jungleDVD object. After that, dvd = new DigitalVideoDisc(oldTitle); create a new object but this object only exists within the scope of the method and doesn't affect the outside jungleDVD.
